"Feud of the Trail ","Feud of the Trail  :  The basic plot is the standard lawman-hero-poses-as-dead-lookalike-outlaw in order to help dead-outlaw's father and sister from losing their ranch to neighboring outlaws, but lots of weird things (even more than usual in a Sam Katzman production)happen along the way, beginning with the cast order as shown on the film; the 4th and 5th billed Jim Corey (misspelled as Correy) and Dick Alexander (known by and billed as such more times than he was as Richard)play a couple of brothers as part of a family gang obviously inspired by Ma Barker and her sons, and only have a couple of lines of dialogue in the whole film, while Roger Williams (as Lance, the only Holcomb brother with a given name) is billed below his two non-talking brothers. Lafe McKee, a major character who talks all the time, goes uncredited, as does director Bob Hill (the name he used on more films than he did Robert F. Hill), who plays the Protective Association Chief, but Hill, while appearing in many of the films he directed seldom took an actors credit. Most of the Victory Pictures produced by Sam Katzman starring Tom Tyler were marked by the unusually small amount of performers seen on screen,and were usually filmed with only two interiors (which set decorator Fred Preble would disguise from film to film by hanging the same set of checkered drapes in different places) and featured a lot of riding around outdoors, and no town scenes. Sam knew if there were no town scenes, he didn't have to pay a dollar or two for people walking across the street or hanging out in the saloon or rent any extra horses to tie to the hitching posts. For reasons unknown, since it had nothing to do with the plot and advanced it not one whit, Jerry McLain (Milburn Morante), who plays the lawman sidekick to Tom Wade (Tom Tyler)and McLain is actually the one who shoots Jack Granger (also played by Tyler), rides to a town and sings (dubbed)""The Old Chisholm Trail"" for a bartender, a piano player and a dozen or so barflies, all of which must have cost Sam at least fifty extra dollars. Morante and Tyler also sing the song (neither one dubbed and should have been)on the trail, and later on Harley Wood (billed as Harlene)plays it on the piano at the ranch and sings nicely, while Tyler sings along in a losing effort. Same song three and a half times in a Victory production is about three and a half more than the norm. The half comes when Morante, after jawing with the bartender, tells the piano player to play it again (Katzman had the piano player on a day rate and probably wanted to get his money's worth) and Morante's dubbed voice takes over again. Plus, the brother-sister relationship when Sheila thinks Tom is her brother is more than a little cozy to begin with, and heats up some when she learns that Tom is not her brother, even though he is his exact double. Somewhere, somebody forgot to shoot the scene where John Granger (Lafe McKee) explains that Sheila is not really Jack's sister, but had been adopted by Pa Granger when her parents were wiped out by ""injuns"" or something. Most likely blew that part of the budget, intended for that scene, on the unneeded barroom scene. A man who's a dead ringer for the leader of an outlaw gang kills the gang leader, then takes his place to try to bring the gang to justice. The Holcombs are after the Granger ranch as they know there is gold on it. When Tom Wade arrives just as Lance Holcomb shoots John Granger, he is mistaken for his look-alike Jack Granger, the outlaw he has just killed. He continues the hoax by posing as Jack as he and sidekick Jerry go after the Holcombs.","Aliens and Science Fiction"

Moses and his associates believe that with the upcoming election, it's time for a new leader to work within the establishment and create a new world of order. And once he's on the inside, he promises the gangs who unite alongside him true power, profit and freedom. However, the Purifiers are a self-contained unit that fights chaos and crime by working outside the realms of the law to preserve the balance of power. They're totally against this concept of unity, as it goes against everything they stand for. But Moses makes it quite clear that those who aren't with him, are against him and his visions and must leave immediately. The Purifiers do so and before they know it, the various gangs, ranging from the Angels, to the Pumas, to the Eels are now trying to rub them out, as they try to make way to their own turf. The gangs want a piece of the action that Moses has offered and each will get their slice of the pie, if and only if, the Purifiers are stamped out of existence because they're an obstacle at this point. However, Moses is merely using this as a test to see what the Purifiers are made of, as he sees potential in John and wants him to work alongside with Moses to realize his goal. As the Purifiers get split up, they decide to go back into the Central Zones to find Raz (the new recruit) and Sol (John's second-in-command), two of their own who went missing in action at the time of the chase. As Li, John's home-girl, tries to piece the puzzle together, she fears that someone within their ranks has turned traitor and is working with Moses to set the Purifiers up for their downfall. While clashing with the various other gangs who are determined to wipe them out, allies will become enemies, truths will be revealed and loyalties will be tested. The question is will the Purifiers still be united and standing as one when the carnage is over?","Fantasy and Quest"

It's the first summer season at Sorrento Vineyards outside of St. Madeleine, California for new co-owners Frankie Baldwin and Nate DeLuca, who were able to overcome the longstanding business feud between the two families and their own animosity to become not only business partners but to fall in love with each other. The general division of responsibilities has Frankie being chief vintner, her goal to produce a Cabernet Sauvignon this season equal to if not better than her award winning wine from the previous season using grapes from her father's vineyard, it more important now to stake a name that is solely Sorrento, while Nate, using his Ph.D. in Science, is in charge of the vineyard and growing the best grapes possible. They hope to stake Sorrento's reputation under their ownership at the upcoming Taste of St. Madeleine, an annual end of summer festival hosted by a local vineyard, at great expense, to pair food prepared by a hired professional chef by each vineyard with the wine produced by that vineyard. Against tradition of hiring a professional, Nate, a home cook, wants to use his culinary skills to match what is sure to be Frankie's sublime Cabernet Sauvignon for this year. A last minute problem leads to Nate making the unilateral decision for Sorrento to host this year's festival. The problem in not clearing it with Frankie is that this year's batch of wine has not aged to the point that it will be ready for the festival, serving a substandard wine or not having a wine to serve as host which would ruin Sorrento's name and thus bust them at the bank. She is reluctant to tell Nate the problem as she tries to figure out a way to hasten the aging process. Another unilateral decision by Nate has the potential to ruin this season's crop of grapes which would further jeopardize their business viability. Frankie and Nate's relationships, both business and personal, may not be able to survive these issues, especially as it exposes fundamental problems in the way they deal with each other. Meanwhile, Marco DeLuca, Nate's younger womanizing brother, has his eye set on Frankie's visiting cousin, up and coming pastry chef Lexi Moreau, a relationship between the two which would be against Frankie's wishes. However, Marco may truly be changing his stripes as he sees Lexi as different than anyone else he's ever met. He just needs to convince Frankie, Lexi and to some extent himself.","War and Humanity"

Up to 12 players can participate in a single game, depending on the map. Players have an isometric view of the map, which consists of hexagonal tiles, and can have up to three layers (surface, caverns, and depths). Units are arranged into groups (also known as parties or stacks) of up to eight units; a single such group occupies one tile. Cities occupy between one and four tiles, and other structures generally occupy a single tile. Each player leads a certain race. There are 12 races available in the game, though not all of them may be present on every map, and of those which are, not all may be playable. List of races includes traditional fantasy Elves, Lizardmen, Humans, Goblins, Dark Elves, Undead, Orcs, Dwarves and Halflings, as well as several unique ones such as Frostlings, Azracs, and Highmen. Races, as well as units not belonging to any specific race, such as dragons and giants, have a certain alignment, which can be good, neutral, or evil. According to their alignment and certain other factors, cities and independent units of one race can be friendly or hostile towards another race. This can manifest itself in different ways; for example, an orc city is not likely to surrender to the elves, and if conquered, may revolt unless there is a strong military presence in it to oppress the population. Units of hostile races forced to fight alongside each other in a single group will have lower morale, and are more likely to desert. Race relations can be improved by acts of goodwill towards other races, such as upgrading their cities, or hampered by razing, looting, or migrating cities belonging to that race. Diplomacy can also affect this and even an alliance with one race might affect the relation of another race. There are also several spells which have a global effect on race relations. There are two resources, gold and mana. Gold is used to build units, buy heroes, cities and spells (in Wizard Towers), upgrade cities. Mana is used to cast and research spells and use altars.",NA

Babak's older brother MOURAD (once a fine player in his own right - but never having the talent of Babak) is attached to the team as they tour the States - perhaps only to handle his brother. The two are very close, but differ ideologically in that Mourad is much more fundamental. The story begins with the Iranian team playing the U.S. squad in Los Angeles. We learn that Babak had been approached months earlier in Iran about possibly staying in the U.S. to play for the local professional team. Babak receives a one million dollar signing bonus to join the Los Angeles Vipers pro team just prior to the end of their regular season and help their chances in the playoffs. Mourad is incensed by his brother's decision and attempts to explain that Babak is compromising his life on many levels - patriotically, religiously, and most importantly, the abandonment of family. Babak can never go home. Babak meets SORAYA, a beautiful, charming Iranian/American who's an up and coming reporter for a national Cable Sports Channel and the sister of the Vipers owner. The two young people have an immediate attraction. Her brother, DR. SHAFAIAN, is a very powerful figure in the local Iranian community. Although he professes to be a friend to Babak, until the end we are unaware of where Dr. Shafaian's loyalties lie. The pressures of a new country, a new soccer team, his brother's cynicism, and the involvement with Soraya all come to a head as the Vipers play the Dallas Panthers for the Championship. Adding to the anxiety is a blackmail plot - threatening to imprison Mourad and the rest of his family should Babak stay, or perhaps be imprisoned himself should he try to return to Iran. This compelling immigrant's story is how one's life is impacted by the decisions of life, family, religion, and morality that face every person chasing the American Dream.","Western and Adventure"

"The Forty-Niners ","The Forty-Niners  :  ""Tennessee"" Matthews is a trader dealing in buffalo hides at his post situated on the North Platte River at Fort Laramie, Wyoming. There Jed Hawkins and his daughter Virginia are waiting for an escort for their wagon trail headed for California. ""Widow"" Melindy Spriggs is also with the train and has intentions of trapping Hawkins as her next husband, although his disposition to drink is very trying to her 'dry' ways. ""Squaw"" O'Hara, called such because he has a habit of taking up with Indian women (which may well be very politically incorrect now, but writer F. McGrew Willis did not name his villain such with an eye on the PC world of the future, and revisionist film history will not intrude here) is hired as the train's scout. O'Hara is one bad character indeed and his real vocation is misguiding wagon trains into traps so they can be looted. At the present time, O'Hara has taken up with a beautiful Indian girl named Lola who lives in a hut where O'Hara makes frequent visits and stores the booty from the many caravans he has betrayed, and has full intentions of doing the same with the Hawkins train. He may only be visiting to check on the inventory, but the pre-code days implication is that he considers Lola as part of the inventory. He and Matthews both fall in love with Virginia, but it is plain to see she prefers Matthews. She even sends him a rose. This displeases O'Hara so much that he beats up Lola out of frustration, and Matthews comes to her aid. He puts an arm around her to comfort her and, of course, that is when Virginia rounds the corner and jumps to the conclusion that Matthews is a two-timer in buckskin.(Which in the real world he might have been since Lola is about three numbers higher on a politically incorrect scale of 1-10 than Virginia is, and Lola ain't no ten herself.) Virginia covers her heartbreak by encouraging O'Hara, which is somewhat akin to pouring coal-oil kerosene on a fire, as O'Hara is not a man who waits for any signs of encouragement anyway. Comes the dawn , O'Hara begins to lead the settlers west to California, but has already notified his Indian friends just where he will lead them for an easy attack. But Matthews has other plans. Earlier Gordon DeMain (as Hawkins) gets drunk and sings ""Oh, Melindy"" to the widow, which marks the only time DeMain sang in a western film and the only time Fern Emmett was serenaded in a film, western or otherwise.","Sports and Competition"

"The Salient ","The Salient  :  The Salient-- the half circle north and east of the Flemish city of Ypres-- was one of the most contested spots of the Great War. No more than five miles across, more than a million people were killed or wounded in this small area during four years of bitter fighting. Over time the Ypres Salient came to symbolize every description heard in conŹjunction with the Great War: sacrifice, courage, honor and duty just as much as chaos, slaughter, calamity and utter senselessness. The film is structured as a requiem , relying on music written for that purpose, mostly 19th century and by composers from both sides of the line. In stark contrast with the beauty of the music are the accounts of people who witnessed the Salient's horrors firsthand. The film thus pits the best of what Europe ever produced against its absolute worst. And so the film turns into a requiem not only for the fallen, but also for a city, an age and, quite possibly, for sanity itself.","Western and Adventure"

"Last Man in Dhaka Central: The Young Man Was, Part III ","Last Man in Dhaka Central: The Young Man Was, Part III  :  November 1975. The Summer of Tigers was a twilight moment for multiple Left possibilities. After the assassination of Salvador Allende, Bangladeshis worried about a similar fate. The end came much more abruptly; instead of a face-off inside a presidential palace, soldiers surprised the guard regiment raising the national flag at dawn. A brutal massacre killed the Prime Minister and his whole family, ending the country's first Socialist government. Three months later, two more coups followed, the last being a Maoist-inspired ""soldiers' mutiny,"" which collapsed in the middle of betrayal and miscalculation. Caught up in this maelstrom was Peter Custers, a Dutch journalist who befriended the leader of the soldiers' mutiny, and had formed his own underground group, Movement for Proletarian Unity. Last Man unspools two stories in reversed sequences. In a series of newsreels and memos, we start at the end-with Peter's release. In the parallel story being told by Peter, his memories unravel over books, magazines, and clippings in his Leiden home, far away from the Bangladesh of 1975 or today. Peter, like many European Leftists of his generation (especially post-Herbert Marcuse's One-Dimensional Man), believed that even if the alienated masses trapped inside modernity were numbed into obedience, the revolutionary spirit might still be found ""outside"" modernity-in the prisons and ghettos of the First World, or in the cities and villages of the Third. It was a search for the latter that led him to drop out of a Ph.D. program at Johns Hopkins and move to Asia in 1973. As he found out, though, there was never a complete outside; a numbed proletariat could also doom Leftist uprisings in the vaunted Third World-as Godard also hinted in La Chinoise (1967). Last Man premiered at the 56th Venice Biennale, in ""All the World's Futures"" curated by Okwui Enwezor. The film intended to begin a long-term dialogue with Peter, but has now become an unintentional memorial: a few months after watching the film in Venice, Peter was making plans to fly to Lisbon for the festival premiere when he passed away unexpectedly. The film now speaks into a void; its last man has finally said goodbye. November 1975. After the assassination of Salvador Allende, Bangladeshis worried about a similar fate.

"The Phantom Creeps ","The Phantom Creeps  :  ""The Phantom Creeps"" was Universal's 44th sound-era serial (between ""The Oregon Trail"" and ""The Green Hornet"") and was re-issued to theaters in 1949 by Commonwealth Pictures Corporation, a distribution set-up handling primarily Universal re-issues. Commonwealth had no hand at all in the production of this serial (as incorrectly shown on site) as they were a distribution company only. Some sources mistakenly identify them as the serial producer because all of the 1949 re-issue prints (and the 16mm prints sold to television circa 1952) show ""Commonwealth Pictures Corp. Presents"" above the title.There is a whole lot of difference between ""presenting"" and ""producing"", a fact that some sources appear to not know or don't care. The serial is of interest to some collectors as it re-unites Bela Lugosi and Edwin Stanley from 1931's ""Dracula"", and the crater-discovery of the meteorite fragment by Zorka in the serial is stock footage from Universal's 1936 ""The Invisible Ray."" The stock footage of an explosion and avalanche used in Chapter 11 comes from Universal's 1934 serial, ""The Vanishing Shadow."" Plot finds eccentric scientist Dr. Alex Zorka carrying on various experiments in his secret laboratory with the aid of his assistant Monk. Zorka has invented many strange weapons of warfare, including a devisualizer belt which renders him invisible; a terrifying, eight-foot tall robot (played by stuntman Edwin ""Bud"" Wolfe and not circus giant Bud Wolff), and he also has a deadly meteorite fragment (which he found in a 1936 movie with Boris Karloff) from which he extracts an element which can induce suspended animation in an entire army. Foreign spies, operating under the guise of a foreign language school (great cover), are trying to buy or (mostly) steal the meteorite element, while his former partner, Dr. Fred Mallory, miffed that Zorka will not turn his inventions over to the U.S. Government, blows the whistle on him to Captain Bob West of the Military Intelligence Department. Tired of answering the door and saying no to the spies and the government, Zorka moves his lab and when his beloved wife is killed, Zorka, puttering around for his own amusement up to this point, gets hacked off as only Lugosi can, swears eternal vengeance against society, and decides to use his inventions to make himself world dictator.

There are many differences between these parties and the Playboy Masquerade. Modern technology, for example, enables today's pleasure seekers to enjoy the very latest in laser light shows, amped up music, chilled cocktails, and VIP transportation. But the similarities to the eighteenth century masked parties are surprisingly evident. For a start, there is great music, provocative dancing, exquisite food and the finest champagnes. There are even VIP areas for those who want to afford more privacy. But most of all, it's the beautiful masks that enable guests, past and present, to adopt a secret identity for the night. Emboldened by the wrong assumption that her identity was hidden, the Queen would rub shoulders with commoners and aristocrats alike; drinking, gambling and enjoying secret encounters. But, such was her beauty and grand style that most there knew who she was.

Her beauty, fashion sense, and ability to charm have left a lasting effect, none more so than tonight at the Playboy Mansion, where forty semi-naked, Marie Antoinette look-a-likes, celebrate the charismatic queen. The young queen's masquerades were a hot-blooded attempt to escape the frustrations of a loveless marriage.

"Streets of Ghost Town ","Streets of Ghost Town  :  Steve, Smiley, and the Sheriff come to a ghost town looking for missing gold. In flashback, Steve tells the story of Bill Donner who doublecrossed his partners to get the gold. Donner, now blind and in jail, refuses to tell where the gold is hidden. Another one of the films from the Durango Kid series where there's only about 20 minutes of new footage shot; the scenes in the ghost town involving the credited players---Charles Starrett, Smiley Burnette, George Chesebro, Mary Ellen Kay, Don Reynolds, Stanley Andrews. Frank Fenton and the uncredited Jack Ingram---and the remaining footage is taken from two 1946 films in the series, ""Gunning For Vengeance"" and ""Landrush"", with the latter dominating most of the running time, but with the majority of the stock-footage scenes covered by a voice-over narration by Charles Starrett telling Sheriff Stanley Andrews the background story that has now led them to the streets of ghost town. The plot here concerns the search for unrecovered loot hidden in the ghost town by double-crossing outlaws. Most of the footage is told in flashback by Starrett, who leaves out the actual ending of ""Landrush"" to make the scenes from it merge into this film. Plus, when he's talking and the people in the stock footage scenes aren't, then the story can be whatever he says it is and not what may have actually transpired in the original films. This leads to a few oddities such as; Starrett's non-Durango character in this one is Steve Woods, but the handbills he hands out in stock footage from ""Landrush"" carry the name of his character in that film, Steve Harmon; George Chesebro has the credited role of Bill Donner, but he also plays henchman in the footage from the other two films, neither of which is named Donner; and Bob Kortman plays henchman from two other films, one with a moustache and one without, and the scene continuity has it appearing and disappearing from one scene to the next, and Jock Mahoney flits in and out doubling Starrett in scenes from three different movies, counting this one. The best scene is in the actual original footage when George Chesebro, as the blinded Bill Donner and playing it in his usual over-the-top at full volume style a la Al Picino(or vice-versa since Chesebro came first),is cornered by outlaw Frank Fenton, and tells Fenton that he can't see him but he can hear him, implying some kind of threat to Fenton's welfare. Fenton, who can both see and hear, promptly shoots him dead. And, speaking of that, players Bud Geary and John Tyrrell were both dead when this film was released, but stock footage has extended more than one career.","Fantasy and Quest"

He rescues Kate Manning ('Barbara Lawrence (I)' (qv)) from being lynched by a mob because she had killed the son of the towns's leading citizen while defending her honor, or what was left of it.

Being smart enough to beat them to the payroll evidently doesn't equate to being smart enough to know the Daltons are going to be more than a little miffed when they find him.

"Ghost Town: The Movie ","Ghost Town: The Movie  :  Dean Teaster's GHOST TOWN ""The Movie"", is a unique ""Eastern"" Western. It is N.C. native Dean Teaster's tribute to his father Robert Doyle Teaster and ""Ghost Town In The Sky"" theme park. The theme park was a large piece of the childhood happiness for Dean's family and many families since its opening in 1961. This story combines actual family facts of the Teaster family fictionalized into a story that encompasses the best elements of the staged gunfights performed by the Legendary ""Ghost Town Gunfighters"" throughout the years at the park. Many of the original actors have returned for roles in the film. Former ""Ghost Town Gunfighters"" Robert Bradley once known as ""The Apache Kid,"" Herbert Cowboy Coward ""GrandPappy,"" and Harry Valentine ""The Golden Voice of Ghost Town"" play pivotal roles in the film as does Alaska Presley who was one of the original park founders. Dean Teaster reprises the role of ""Digger"" made famous by his father. This movie was created to offset many of the ""Hillbilly"" stereotypes often depicted with this area. The movie paints a picture of this beautiful mountain region that was settled by the overseas Celtic people. These settlers were full of rich traditions and a true grit that allowed them to survive and thrive during the rugged 1800's period of US History often shown in western films. This movie may well be the birth of a sub genre of the western known as ""The Eastern."" With a slight romantic edge this movie is chalked full of messages about love, hate, family, forgiveness, redemption and sacrifice.
